# SMP Skill: Basic Javascript - Practical
This task is part of the SMP Basic JavaScript Certification course.
It implements a note feature that allows users create notes, delete notes and also sorts these data according to the criteria below.

## Requirements:
- Add new note: Clicking on the "Add new note +" button should create a new note in the notes container.
- Delete note: Clicking on the "Delete" button should remove the corresponding note.
- Note sort: Users can sort notes based on the following criteria:
  - ID (Descending): Notes are sorted by ID from highest to lowest (default)
  - ID (Ascending): Notes are sorted by ID from lowest to highest.
  - Title (A-Z): Notes are sorted alphabetically by title from A to Z.
  - Title (Z-A): Notes are sorted alphabetically by title from Z to A.

> No Storage was applied therefore notes are not saved to any database or locally and are cleared once the user refreshes the page.

## Added Bonus Feature
- Prevent user from adding a new note without prefilling the title of a previously added note.

## File Structure:
- index.html: Holds the html code structure of the page and renders the js functions.
- index.js: Holds the javscript functions and logic.
- styles.css: Holds the css styling of the project.
- README.md: Contains readme instructions to the project.
